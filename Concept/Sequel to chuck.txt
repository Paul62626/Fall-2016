  ==============================================================================================================================================================================================
  ==============================================================================================================================================================================================
  
  
  Potential Larger Story:
  Try to do a large multi-weaved Main Story that involves multiple main characters.  (Different Playthroughs)
  
  Backdrop:
  Land of Rio Naturio(or something starting with an R, followed by a word starting with an N) -> Important for name of CHUCK the Chicken's home place
  B.A.R.N. -> The farmtown of B.A.R.N., stationed in a battleship above (Rio Naturio)
  
  Several potential Main Character lines that all weave together
  
  Main Enemy -> The Great Human Advancement (Humans coming into the land and buying out zones to construct this hideous large Amusement Park)
  
  Philosophy of the CHUCK Main Quest line
  1. Chuck needs to stop humans from taking the B.A.R.N. for the Amusement Park
  2. Wise Old Goat tells him to travel outside of B.A.R.N. to the farthest reaches to assemble an army
  3. At each location CHUCK learns a little about the outside world, and how the humans are attacking it as well
  
  Points of interest in the CHUCK Story-line
  1. Torva -> Land of the Tortoise/Frog Sculptist/Engineers
  2. White Fruit Forest -> Holy Ground where the 3 Great Bear Nations came to meet at
      a. Grand Clearing    -> Place where the Great Bear Nations fought to the death
      b. Base of Gravi Mount   -> Mountain where the Pork Chops go to learn the art of Pork-fu and train in meditation
      c. Grand Bear Highway -> Road leaving WFF that connects the Capital Cities of each of the Great Bear Nations
  3. Hot Talon Peaks -> Wicked land of crags and volcanoes, where the Bird Races practice magic
  4. Jundub -> City of the Builders (Beaver & Platypus)
  5. Kuralu -> Black Rock Hills (Snake, Lizard, Large Insects) -> Assassins, Impossible to gain entrance for a while
  6. Zuhun -> Woodlands (Raccoon, Skunk, Opossum, Badger, Fox, Cats, Elk, Deer)
  7. Chu-Lara -> The Great Prairie and Great Savanna (Lions, Elephant, Rhino, Hippo, Crocs, Great Stampede Races, Prairie Dogs)
  8. The Purple Flatts -> Home of the Buffalo.  Vast expanse of purple flowers as far as the eyes can see in all directions
  9. The Badlands -> Land of the Dogs/Wolves/Great Hounds
  10. Gravi Mount -> Mountain where the Pork-Fu Masters reside and meditate
  11. Sak-Shak Desert -> Land of the Weavers and Musicians (Camels, Vultures, Spiders, etc..)
  
  Actual Gameplay Chuck Storyline
  1. Opens up in the Barn
  2. Can go to Jundub, Zuhun(hard to find), Chu-Lara, The Purple Flatts, or Sak-Shak, The Badlands(Not smart to visit)

   c. Chu-lara -> Get involved in a major Civil War in which become part of one of the 3 factions and fight until it is over
   d. TPF -> Can visit the Great Wall of Jundub, can learn Herbology, enlists the BUFFALO for future lifting or moving assistance
   e. Zuhun -> Land of the Spys, learn about the Wise Old Goat, and find some rather gnarly opening game equipment
   f. The Badlands -> The Great Hounds do everything to tear you up at this point in the story.  Met with aggression all over.
  3. Bridge to Torva is built after all of these but Zuhun and The Badlands is visited (neither affect Bridge being built)
  4. Befriending a Torvan allows the Kuraluuns to give you passage into their land.  For they haven't seen one in forever, and are intrigued.

   a. Go to Gravi Mount to receive access to the Great Bear Highway
   b. Enlist 1 of the survivors of the Great Bear-Polar War in one of the 3 Capitals
  6. After Gravi Mount, The Badlands become readily accessible.  Having a Pork Chop follow you, makes them non-aggressive.
  7. Wise Old Goat tells about Zuhun (where he gets his intel from)

  Random Lore Nuggets
  
  Chu-Lara is inaccessible to JUNDUBI because the JUNDUBI are the ones that effecively ended the market for slavery
  between Sak-Shak and Chu-lara
  
  JUNDUBI are hardworkers and great builders but lack the understanding of Physics that the great Torvean Engineers have
  
  The Zuhunites are the messengers that the Old Goat is hearing from in between each major Plot Point. (A fox specifically)
  
  Zuhun is available at the start but is not easily found, being only accessible through underground cave paths that are guarded
  by some rather nasty creatures
  
  There are a ton of great Pubs though in Zuhun with NPCs that love to just jack around and make jokes.  They are a fun crowd,
  and sell some of the finest weapons and armaments.
  
  Clancy was directly responsible for the Bridge to Torva being built.
  
  The Great Bear Nations were split by their fur and met at the White Fruit Forest which was the prized area that was accessible to
  all of the different Nations.  It was the only place in the world that could be good habitat for all living creatures.
  
  Zuhunites consist of Mercs, Assassins, Spys, Politicians, and Guards, and other forms of interesting folk.
  
  The inhabitants of Kuralu are phenominal with ranged and/or toxin based combat.  Hence why the Black Rock Hills are not able
  to be visited unless they want you there.
  
  The Buffalo of The Purple Flatts are gentle giants and master some of the more fragile crafts.  They are masters of Medicine and Herbology.
  They also are well-known for their strength in lugging things around.
  
  The Bird Races of Hot Talon Peaks are the very Sorcerors responsible for the existence of monsters in the land.  Due to their dabbling in 
  dark arts, the non-animalians appeared in the land and started wreaking havoc all around.  Few realize though, that it was that very
  fact that has kept the humans from completely taking every inch of the land.  The monsters made it harder for the humans to push
  out and expand.  Which technically means that the people of Hot Talon Peaks saved the world from one enemy temporarily by 
  summoning another to fight it.
  
  The Bird Races of Hot Talon Peaks are feared by all Races for their involvement in Magic.
  
  The small stretch of land where The Badlands is neighboring to the Purple Flatts is becoming larger.  More and more often the
  Great Hounds push inwards and take more land and more kills from the peaceful Buffalo.
  
  The raiders from The Badlands killed enough of the people of the Purple Flatts in the years since the Humans came into the picture
  then the last 100 years before that, which leads some to think that the Great Hounds are not quite as evil as they seem.  They might
  just be taking some serious punishment from the humans and be doing all they can to survive.
  
  None of the Great Hounds will join Chuck, seeing as they don't believe anymore in teamwork.  They have been pushed away from their 
  home by humans that gather them on sight and take them for food.  So to them it is a Dog-eat-Dog world.  There is food, and then there
  is being food for others.
  
  Some of the Lesser Hounds though will join Chuck, if promised enough kills, and food.
  
  Pork Chops will only join Chuck, if Chuck agrees to remove his Weapon Slot and train to fight without weapons.
  
  Pork Chops fight with their hands and live off of what the world provides.  Hence why they never are seen carrying anything but
  themselves.
  
  Going into The Badlands after a Pork Chop is in your party will make the Hounds non-aggressive towards you.  They are afraid of the
  Pork Chops because of their resemblance to The Great Boar of the North and the Humans of the North-East.
  
  Chu-Lara used to have large monuments build off of slave labor.
  
  Chu-Lara right off the bat sold 1/3 of their land to the humans.
  
  Chu-Lara's King selling the land to the humans lead to the Great Faction Split and Civil War that began soon after Chucks' birth.
  
  Chu-Lara's Caste System
   1. Royalty
    a. King -> Elephant
    b. King's Guard -> Rhino & Hippo
    c. Other Large Beasts
   2. Commoners
    a. Horned Deer-Breeds
    b. Deer-Breeds
    c. Apes
    d. Monkeys
    e. Prairie Dogs
   3. The Despised
    a. Crocs
    b. Leopard
    c. Hyena
    d. Lion
    
  The Ancient trade of Chu-Lara mainly consisted of selling the captured (Despised) Caste to any neighboring Kingdom that would pay.
  
  This Ancient trade of slaves was especially prevalent in Sak-Shak, due to the fact that the "Master-Line" was crafted from 
  Lion's Mane and Tails.
  
  The Despised were sold for labor, parts, war-dummies, and all sorts of horrible things.
  
  The Bridge to Torva is the largest bridge in the world, even bigger than all the bridge built by humans since their involvement in the
  world.
  
  The Camel Tribes of Sak-Shak are split into 3 main groups that all have their own understanding of a Great Prophecy.
  
  The Great Prophecy
   "In the End of Days there will be a great foe appearing that will threaten every nation to the point of extinction.  This great
    enemy will come from the North-Western lands and bring with them a wierd magic and craft.  In the midst of the panic, a Savior
    will rise from Sak-Shak to push the Evil back from whence it came.  This hero will be born of the True House of Sak-Shak"
    
   The Monab Tribe think that the savior is Jak-Bal the most recently appointed King.
   The Dujab Tribe think that the savior is Ambi-lof the great-great-great grandchild of the 1st King of Sakshak.
   The Thirab Tribe think that the savior hasn't been born and will be revealed only when the Great Evil is at the 
    border of SakShak.
    
   This difference in religion and the difficulty of making the "Master-Line" is what makes it tough for Clancy to convince them
    to make some again.
    
   MDT -> Craftsmen (camels)
    a. weaves the master line
    b. searching for the savior
    c. each tribe will send their personal savior along with you (none of them really are any real use)
    d. shut off more from the rest of the world because of the differences
    e. teaches about the "SONGS OF LIFE"
    
   The Pork Chops stand guard to every single entrance to the White Fruit Forest, because of the great atrocity that it is.  No mortal
    eyes should lay sight upon the carnage of the Great Bear-Polar War.
    
   The Pork Chops martial art originated from a Great Boar of the North who had to fight against the Wolves in a war that predates
    the main story by 120 years
    
   The Master Line is made from 
    a. Lion's Mane & Tail
    b. Ash from Hot Talon Peaks
    c. Fruit of the Blue Spine-Tree
    d. Magic that is considered blasphemous every since the Great Prophecy.
